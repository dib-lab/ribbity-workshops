You will be introduced to R syntax, variables, functions, packages, and data structures. You will learn the basics of data wrangling including importing data from files, subsetting, joining, filtering, and more. You will gain hands-on practice calculating and visualizing differential gene expression using popular open-source packages and public RNA-Seq data from the Gene Expression Tissue Project (GTEx).

In this 2 hour workshop, we will use R to explore publicly-available RNA-Seq data from the Gene Expression Tissue Project (GTEx). Attendees will be introduced to the R syntax, variables, functions, packages, and data structures common to RNA-Seq projects. We will use RStudio to import, tidy, transform, and visualize RNA-Seq count data. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for making the processes of data wrangling and data harmonization more manageable. This workshop will not cover cloud-based workflows for processing RNA-seq reads or statistics and modeling because these topics are covered in our RNA-Seq Concepts and RNA-Seq in the Cloud workshops. Rather, this workshop will focus on general R concepts applied to RNA-Seq data. Familiarity with R is not required but would be useful.

So it's good for today's demo; I suggest trying new/different files as a Thursday exercise!) Export your personal collection Go to your collection, and select \"export\" and choose \"NCPI manifest format.\" :::info What is NCPI? \"NCPI\" stands for \"NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability\", an effort by the NIH to convene around interoperation for cloud workbenches. ::: Examine the NCPI manifest file You should now have a CSV file in your Downloads that, when examined with a spreadsheet program, looks like this: The key piece of information in here is the drs_uri column, which provides a Data Repository Service location from which to download the files. Connect to your AWS instance/on JupyterHub We've installed some software for you on AWS , and you should receive a Web link to your AWS instance Web site in zoom chat (during today's demo, at least ;). Log in to JupyterHub You should see: Use username cfde . (We'll give you the sekret password in Zoom chat.) You should now be at a JupyerHub console. Open Jupyter notebook Go to the demo/ folder and open demo-walkthrough.ipynb by clicking on it. You can also see a static version of the walkthrough .
